This is a modified version of the Apple example project "Capturing depth using the LiDAR camera" that can be found here:

Modifications were made as part of a study titled "Efficient and Privacy-Protecting Background Removal for 2D Video Streaming using iPhone 15 Pro Max LiDAR" 
by Jessica Kinnevan, Naifa Alqahtani, and Toral Chauhan at Iowa State University. 

It provides user interface that allows the user to remove the background based on the depth of the subject, replace the background with an image, 
perform edge smoothing of the subject, and adjust alpha (transparency) roll-off.
